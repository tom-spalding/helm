# Helm

A personal knowledge management desktop app built with Tauri + React. Notes are stored as local markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Features a TipTap editor, Eisenhower matrix, Kanban board, force-directed graph, and 6 color themes.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Node.js | ≥ 20 | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or `brew install node` |
| Rust | stable | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` |
| Tauri CLI | v2 | included as a dev dependency (`npm run tauri`) |
| Xcode CLI Tools | (macOS) | `xcode-select --install` |

Verify your Rust setup:
```sh
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

---

## Running Locally

```sh
# Install JS dependencies
npm install

# Start the Tauri dev window (also starts the Vite dev server)
npm run tauri dev
```

This opens a native app window backed by a hot-reloading React frontend. Rust changes require a full recompile; frontend changes hot-reload instantly.

To run just the Vite frontend in a browser (no Tauri APIs):
```sh
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:1420
```

> **Note:** File system operations (reading/writing notes) require the full Tauri dev environment. The browser-only mode is useful for UI work that doesn't touch the vault.

## Building

### Development build (debug)

```sh
npm run tauri build -- --debug
```

Output: `src-tauri/target/debug/bundle/`

### Production build

```sh
npm run tauri build
```

Output: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

On macOS this produces:
- `macos/Helm.app` — the app bundle
- `dmg/Helm_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg` — the distributable disk image

---

## Creating a DMG (macOS)

The DMG is built automatically as part of `npm run tauri build`. You'll find it at:

```
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Helm_<version>_aarch64.dmg
```

To distribute the DMG, you'll need to **sign and notarize** it. Set these environment variables before building:

```sh
export APPLE_CERTIFICATE="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
export APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD="keychain-password"
export APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
export APPLE_ID="you@example.com"
export APPLE_PASSWORD="app-specific-password"   # from appleid.apple.com
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="YOURTEAMID"
```

Then build normally:
```sh
npm run tauri build
```

Tauri handles code signing, notarization, and stapling automatically when those variables are present.

For an **unsigned** local build (no Apple Developer account needed), just run `npm run tauri build` without setting those variables. The app will work on your own machine but macOS Gatekeeper will block it on other machines by default.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server only (browser, no Tauri) |
| `npm run tauri dev` | Full Tauri dev window with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | TypeScript check + Vite production build |
| `npm run tauri build` | Full native app + DMG (release mode) |
| `npm run test` | Run Vitest unit tests once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Vitest in watch mode |
| `npm run test:ui` | Vitest browser UI |

---

## Vault Format

A vault is a folder of `.md` files. Each file has YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: 01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV
title: My Note
created: 2025-03-13
updated: 2025-03-13
tags:
  - work/project-x
urgent: false
important: true
state: Doing
blocked: false
---

Note body with [[wiki links]] and #inline-tags.
```

Notes are plain files — you can edit them with any text editor, sync with iCloud/Dropbox/git, or use them with other Obsidian-compatible tools.
